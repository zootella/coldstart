Secrets
- [ ] The server has API keys the browser cannot access

Time
- [ ] Page shows time from the browser
- [ ] Page shows time from the server, and the difference between the clocks

Wait
- [ ] Page shows the user's true wait time, from the browser navigation to the page showing components rendered from data from the database

Client and server side code
- [ ] Client code validates an email
- [ ] The same code running on the server validates the email

Data
- [ ] Global counter, increment button, when last clicked, and by whom

Identification
- [ ] The page knows if this browser has been here before, saving an identifier, and letting the user set a nickname
- [ ] More than one year later, the nickname is still there, allowing the user to still be signed in

Routes and cards
- [ ] The user can navigate between routes on the site, which look like pages but are just DOM updates
- [ ] Links to routes in the site render to custom titles and image cards in third-party social media sites and chat apps, using Open Graph protocol (Meeting this requirement may change earlier choices about client and server-side rendering)
